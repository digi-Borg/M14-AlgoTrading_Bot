*"Using a MachineLearning Algorithmic Trading Bot that adapts to new data and evolving markets."* 

## Background

This project creates an algorithmic trading bot that learns and adapts to new data and evolving markets for a financial advisory firm. Seeking to maintain an advantage over the competition, initiatives are taken to make improvements to the existing algorithmic trading system. The plan is to enhance the current trading signals by testing different classified machine learning (ML) algorithms in a Python notebook. By testing different classified MLs, performance can be compared to adaptation of new data under differing market environments. 

The FinTech technology in this program utilizes ScikitLearn ML algorithm software tools. The tools are used to build algorithmic models by adjusting inputs for buy, sell or hold signals; these signals are derived from a technical indicator called simple moving average(SMA). SMA's calculate the average stock prices over a rolling time period designating a number of days in time windows. 

Using the pandas rolling function with the `window` parameter the time can be specified and adjusted from days to minutes depending on your trading strategies. A short-window(usually 10, 20, 50 days) and long-window(usually 100,200 days) are designated to illustrate positive or negative price trends. When looking at a chart for example, the short window 20 day SMA crosses over the long-window 100 day SMA a trigger point to enter or exit a trade. These SMA crossover points known as dual-moving-average-crossover(DMAC) signal buys or sells by our algorithm model.  

Adjusting the ML algorithm inputs one can put together models, tune them, visualize performance on charts, and backtest them for evaluation on a Classification Report. Additionaly, other classes of ML models are available for backtesting and predicting outcomes before applying them to your strategies.

## Technologies

The software operates on python 3.9 with the installation package imports embedded with Anaconda3 installation. Pandas, NumPy, hvplot, Matplotlib and scikitlearn are libraries for imported tools this program uses to build the program to analyze stock prices and set decision signals of when to buy and sell shares.  The application tools that you need for this module to construct models to perform ML algorithms are SVC, LogisticRegression, AdaBoostClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier.  Please reference the formerly named ML algorithm classifiers on the official web site [Supervised Learning for scikit ML Classifiers Install Guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) installation and documentation.

# Usage

This application is launched from web-based Jupyter notebook utilizing Pandas and scikitlearn `StandardScaler` to preprocess data for categorical variables in the algorithm ML model computations. Scikit ML models SVC, LogisticRegression, AdaBoostClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier allows tuning to adapt to different trading strategies and market environments.  and `accuracy` evaluation metrics.    

The program is developed in Jupyter notebook on a jupyter **.ipny** file. The Python library makes it possible to utilize pandas, numpy and pathlib to build this ML algorithm. The design applies the model-fit-predict process to make a binary classification of whether a startup is successful or not.
